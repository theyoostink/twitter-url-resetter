3. Load the extension by clicking on the `Load unpacked` button on the top left.
4. Select the folder from Step 1 that holds `background.js`, `content.js`, and `manifest.json`.
5. The extension should now be loaded into your browser. Make sure the extension is enabled.
6. Visit Twitter and URLs will be reset and clean!
7. You can manage the extension like any other extension. You can disable and remove the extension as needed.
8. To update to the latest version of the extension, remove/delete the extension and repeat the steps starting with Step 1 using the latest version of the code.
